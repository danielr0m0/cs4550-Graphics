My solution to this homework assignment is similar to homework 2.
I looked at the square example to figure out how I was going to draw 
my shape with at least three colors. With moving the rectangle i first
made sure moving the rectangle will not cause it to go out of range. I only
allow the rectangle to move within the area.
